Subject: [PATCH] MC-99321 - Dont check for blocked double chest for hoppers
 etc

This is a source of MAJOR lag for hoppers, as well as a gameplay bug.

This removes the necessity to disable the cat on chest behavior to improve performance.

now performance will be improved even if you have cat chest detection on.
