Subject: [PATCH] Don't load Chunks from Hoppers and other things

Hoppers call this to I guess "get the primary side" of a double sided chest.

If the double sided chest crosses chunk lines, it causes the chunk to load.
This will end up causing sync chunk loads, which will unload with Chunk GC,
only to be reloaded again the next tick.

This of course is undesirable, so just return the loaded side as "primary"
and treat it as a single chest if the other sides are unloaded
