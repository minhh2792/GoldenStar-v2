## GoldenStar v2 ![Github Actions Build](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/minhh2792/GoldenStar-v2/Build?logo=github)

A highly customized version of Paper 1.12.2

**NOTE**: Please don't use it in your server

## Why ?

MineVN Minigames currently developing auto-scale room and matchmaking system, when players create a room and start the game, a Paper 1.12.2 instance will be started. So if there are 35 rooms are currently running = 35 Paper instances.

To reduce startup time, GoldenStar is made to remove some unnecessary initialization during startup and features, while also adding stuffs that fits our system
